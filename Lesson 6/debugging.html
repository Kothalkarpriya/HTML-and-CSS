    <!-- 2.	Let’s Understand the Problems:
            •	The Paragraph and List item has no closing tags in it. 
            •	The first <strong> tag/element also have no closing tag. This is more problem-causing, as it is not simple to get where the element is to end. Thus, all the remaining texts get strongly emphasized.
            •	This line is enclosed withing more than one tag:
            •	<strong>strong <em>strong emphasized</strong>what is this? </em>. It is not understandable how to interpret them because of the earlier problem.
            •	At last, the href value is not enclosed within the quotes, as the quote is missing. This caused a big problem; the link has not been rendered at all.

     <!-- Using HTML validation to debug -->
    <h1>HTML debugging examples</h1>
    <p>What causes errors in HTML?
        <ul>
            <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly, then its effect can spread to areas you
                    didn't intend</strong></li>
            <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly.
                <strong>strong <em>strong emphasized?</em></strong>
                <em>what is this?</em> </li>
            <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example: <a href="https://skillcart.org/">like to skillcart homepage</a>
            </li>
    </ul>
